# CloudSound/Porobits
The tangible media group at the MIT Medial Lab takes human computer interfaces to a whole new level: tangible user interface. Porobits is an accompanying tablet app that allows users to record sound to a specific 'cloud' which inflates to indicate that it is storing sound and deflates when clicked on to play the sound stored in it.
